---
My name is Yang Liu, a final-year PhD candidate in Communication and Information System at Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS). My advisor is professor [Yang Yang](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2018/1227/c3846a38413/page.htm). 
My project involves mobile interaction, embedded system, wireless localization. Currently, my work focuses on novel mobile interaction technologies using wireless signals, especially acoustic signals. Recently, I have designed and developed an acoustic based localization and tracking prototype system using an android smartphone and some commercial speakers, which could provide fine-grained motion tracking in 2D and 3D space, and could detect small and slow movement (e.g. human breathing). I’m highly self-motivated, because I hope that the knowledge that I learned could help me to bring inventive ideas into real-world applications.

## Work Experience

### Research at Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology (SIMIT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China (Sept. 2016- Present)

I have designed and developed an acoustic based localization and tracking prototype system using an android smartphone and commercial speakers. The system could provide fine-grained mobile interaction in 2D and 3D space with high sensitivity.

I have designed and developed a prototype system for detecting gas leakage based on the distinctive acoustic spectrum change caused by gas leakage, which will be deployed to some natural gas wells of Shanghai as a pilot project.

### Research at Shanghai Research Center for Wireless Communications, Shanghai, China (Oct. 2014- Sept. 2016)

I have designed and developed a prototype system for intelligent pillow to avoid snoring using an embedded system, which could adjust the height of the pillow automatically according to the snore it heard. 

By migrating and modifying the Linux kernel module (ath9k) of OpenWrt, I have developed OpenWrt based wireless router, which could get Channel State Information (CSI) of WiFi signal between commercial router and smartphones.

### Project Intern at Topelec Tech, Co. Ltd, Beijing,China (Feb. 2014- Aug. 2014)

I have finished studies and applications about network protocol in practical projects, such as uIP, Zigbee 2007/pro and 900M RFID.

### Teaching Assistant (Sept. 2013- Jan. 2014)
As a teaching assistant, I assisted our teacher to address students' questions and gave a course about digital circuit design experiment for undergraduates.

### Intern at EDA Laboratory of Beihang University, Beijing, China (June 2013- Sept. 2013)
Before the start of my graduate studies, Professor Jinming Dong gave me an opportunity to join the EDA laboratory. 

### Summer student at school’s innovation Laboratory of Anhui University (July 2009- Aug. 2009)
I had the opportunity to work at the school’s innovation lab for National Undergraduate Electronic Design Contest.
