toc: true
---

My name is Yang Liu, a final-year PhD candidate in Communication and Information System at Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS). My advisor is professor [Yang Yang](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2018/1227/c3846a38413/page.htm). 
I received the Bachelor degree from Anhui University, China, in 2012, and Master degree from Beihang University, China, in 2016.
My project involves mobile interaction, embedded system, wireless localization. Currently, my work focuses on novel mobile interaction technologies using wireless signals, especially acoustic signals. Recently, I have designed and developed an acoustic based localization and tracking prototype system using an android smartphone and some commercial speakers, which could provide fine-grained motion tracking in 2D and 3D space, and could detect small and slow movement (e.g. human breathing). I’m highly self-motivated, because I hope that the knowledge that I learned could help me to bring inventive ideas into real-world applications.
